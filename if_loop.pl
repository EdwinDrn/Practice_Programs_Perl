#Created on May 7, 2020 by Edwin Duran

#Take a given set variable '11'
my $var1 = 11;
#$var2 = 11;

#If the variable meets the if condition, the appropriate response is printed.
if ($var1 == 2){
  #echo "Edwin"
  print "This is a basic if loop.\n";
}
else{
  print "Wrong password.\n";
}

#Below is test code that I commented out.

#print "What is your age? ";
#my $age = <STDIN>;
#if ($age >= 18) {
#    print "In most countries you can vote.\n";
#} else {
#    print "You are too young to vote\n";
